# üåæ Beckn Implementation Guide ‚Äì Outcome Visualization: Soil Testing (UKI)

## Overview

This guide demonstrates how to implement a soil testing service journey on the Unified Krishi Interface (UKI), using the Beckn Protocol. It is intended to help developers and network participants (BAPs, BPPs) understand the roles, flows, and technical implementation for integrating soil testing services.

The use case follows the DOFP (Discovery ‚Üí Order ‚Üí Fulfilment ‚Üí Post-Fulfilment) model and highlights how a farmer (Smita) discovers, books, and receives soil testing services from a Beckn-compatible platform.

---

## Scope

- üì≤ Actors: Farmer (BAP), Soil Testing Service Provider (BPP), Taxonomy APIs
- üåê Context: Soil testing discovery and service booking via Beckn-enabled agri platform
- üîÅ Protocol Flow: Beckn API lifecycle applied to Soil Testing

## Network Participants and Beckn Roles

This section explains the key entities involved in the soil testing use case and their mapped roles within the Beckn protocol ecosystem.

| **Entity**                         | **Beckn Role** | **Description** |
|-----------------------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Smita (Farmer)**                | BAP            | Uses a Beckn-enabled agri app to search, book, and receive soil testing services. |
| **Krishi Kendra Soil Services**   | BPP            | Provides soil testing services and integrates into UKI via Beckn. Responds to search, confirm, fulfill requests. |
| **Delivery Agent**                | Part of BPP    | Collects soil sample from Smita‚Äôs farm or receives it at the testing center. |
| **Krishitantra or Taxonomy API**  | External System| Provides standardized taxonomy like crop types, test categories, etc., used by both BAP and BPP. |
| **UKI Network Gateway**           | Registry/Router| Facilitates discovery and message routing between BAP and BPP nodes. |

## DOFP Journey ‚Äì Soil Testing via Beckn

The interaction follows the standard Beckn protocol phases: **Discovery ‚Üí Order ‚Üí Fulfilment ‚Üí Post-Fulfilment**, enabling an end-to-end digital journey for soil testing.

### üîç 1. Discovery

- Smita (BAP) searches for soil testing services near her farm via the app.
- BPP (e.g., Krishi Kendra) responds with available services, including:
  - Ratings
  - Service types (NPK, micronutrients, etc.)
  - Cost, availability, and location
  - Pickup or drop-off options
- Smita filters and selects a preferred provider.

---

### üì¶ 2. Order

- Smita views detailed quote and service info.
- Krishi Kendra (BPP) shares:
  - Time slots
  - Pricing (pickup vs drop-off)
  - Pre-requisites (PDFs, videos)
  - Terms and conditions
- Smita confirms the service and selects payment (e.g., Cash on Delivery).
- BPP confirms the booking and provides order ID + pickup details.

---

### üöö 3. Fulfilment

**Two modes:**

‚úÖ **Farm Pickup**:
- Delivery agent visits Smita‚Äôs farm, collects the soil sample.
- Payment is done at pickup.
- Smita receives real-time status updates.

‚úÖ **Self Drop-off**:
- Smita collects the sample and delivers it to the testing center.
- She follows instructions shared earlier.
- She receives status updates post-drop.

---

### üßæ 4. Post-Fulfilment

- Smita receives a test report (PDF) with insights (text, video, image).
- She gives feedback/rating on:
  - Service quality
  - Provider behavior
- BPP can follow up for deeper insights.
- Smita can reach out to support if issues arise.

## Beckn API Flow ‚Äì Soil Testing Journey

The following sequence represents the key API interactions between the BAP (Smita‚Äôs app) and BPP (Krishi Kendra Soil Services) during the soil testing use case:

| **Step**         | **API**           | **Initiated By** | **Purpose** |
|------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ Search        | `search`          | BAP              | Smita searches for nearby soil testing centers. |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ On Search     | `on_search`       | BPP              | BPPs respond with matching services, slots, pricing, etc. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ Select        | `select`          | BAP              | Smita selects a preferred testing service. |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ On Select     | `on_select`       | BPP              | BPP confirms availability and responds with selection details. |
| 5Ô∏è‚É£ Init          | `init`            | BAP              | BAP initiates the order request with all needed info. |
| 6Ô∏è‚É£ On Init       | `on_init`         | BPP              | BPP validates and confirms service initiation. |
| 7Ô∏è‚É£ Confirm       | `confirm`         | BAP              | Final order confirmation with payment preference (COD). |
| 8Ô∏è‚É£ On Confirm    | `on_confirm`      | BPP              | BPP shares confirmed order ID, agent details. |
| 9Ô∏è‚É£ Status        | `status`          | BAP              | BAP checks current status of collection/delivery. |
| üîü Update         | `update`          | BPP              | BPP pushes live status updates to BAP. |
| üîÅ Rating         | `rating`          | BAP              | Smita gives feedback for the service post-fulfilment. |
| ‚úÖ On Rating      | `on_rating`       | BPP              | BPP acknowledges feedback and may ask for follow-up. |

### Notes:
- The sequence follows standard Beckn protocol lifecycles.
- All payloads conform to Beckn schema v1.2 (or latest supported by UKI).
- Multimedia content (videos/PDFs) is shared as URLs within payloads (e.g., `desc.url`).

---

## Developer Notes, Tags & Assumptions

### üìå Tags & Taxonomy Assumptions

- `collection_type`: "Farm Pickup" / "Drop-off at Centre"
- `test_type`: "NPK", "Micro Nutrients", "Soil Texture", "Water Test"
- `location.district` and `location.state`: Mapped to BPP serviceable zones
- `crop_type`, `crop_variety`: Sourced from Krishitantra‚Äôs external API
- `media.url`: Used to share preparation instructions (PDF, image, video)

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions

- BAP supports local language input (Smita can search in Marathi).
- All payments are offline (COD), no digital transaction integration shown.
- Report sharing is asynchronous and happens via media URL in `update` or support contact.
- External taxonomy (e.g., crop categories) may evolve and are assumed dynamic.

---

### üí° Developer Notes

- BAP & BPP nodes must be registered with UKI registry and follow Beckn OpenAPI schemas.
- All communication must be signed and timestamped as per protocol.
- Optional fields like `previous_crop`, `yield`, `feedback_rating` help enhance services but are not mandatory.
- System clocks must be in sync with IST (important for booking slots).
- Payloads stored in `/payloads/` folder are simplified and can be expanded as needed.
